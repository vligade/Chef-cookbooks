# For backward compatibility it can be defined as an array or as a Hash.
#
# If it is defined as a hash, by default versions for each packages is nil. So it will install the latest one available in repositories.
#
# By default followings are defined and can be adjusted for your tate in your wrapper cookbook

#   }
# These version information can be overriden in your environment specific attributes so you can intall any version you prefer
#
# In case of defining as an array, it is as usual. It will install latest version found in repositories
